What makes him so unique is that he worked in WWE for several years before discovering the gimmick that made him a massive star. When Godfather entered the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016, he said the reason his last gimmick worked was because it was who he really was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Higher Power Storyline, Explained" href=#>The Higher Power Storyline, Explained</a></span></p><p>In the previous gimmicks, he was nothing like the freewheeling and happy-go-lucky Godfather. He was a horror-centric voodoo priest, an MMA fighter, and a militant. He never could make any of those gimmicks work right, mostly because he was playing a character instead of just being himself, which was what happened when he took on the role of The Godfather.</p><h2 id=the-soultaker><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Soultaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/godfather-1.jpg><p>Godfather was really raw when he got his start, but so were most wrestlers in the business. This includes Undertaker, and both Godfather and Undertaker got their start around the same time in the USWA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Godfather, he was known as Soultaker, a gimmick based on one of his tattoos. He won the USWA World Championship and held it for two weeks, but he was in no way ready for that kind of title yet. This gimmick was perhaps just a sign of better things to come.</p><h2 id=kama-the-supreme-fighting-machine><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kama, The Supreme Fighting Machine</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kama.jpg><p>When talking about his past gimmicks, Godfather said none of them felt like the real him. When it came to Kama, The Supreme Fighting Machine, it was a little like him because <a href=#>Godfather was a legit shoot fighter</a> who could hold his own.</p><p>However, when it came to WWE, he was asked to be a mean and tough brawler, and was paired with Ted DiBiase as a manager. He even <a href=#>fought in the Brawl for All</a>. He lasted one year with the gimmick and left the promotion in 1996.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wwe-hall-of-fame-legend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>WWE Hall of Fame Legend</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Godfather-WWE-Hall-of-Fame.jpg><p>WWE loves to have fun with several of its legendary wrestlers. When it comes to Godfather, there have been numerous moments where he has come back, and he gets a huge pop every time. Sometimes he comes in with his Ho Train, which is not as widely accepted as it used to be, but fans still seem to love it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 WWE Wrestlers Who Never Lived Up To Their Potential" href=#>10 WWE Wrestlers Who Never Lived Up To Their Potential</a></span></p><p>He also got to work with Matt Hardy on one of his cinematic specials on the WWE Network, and pulled out a bunch of old gimmicks for fun.

Sadly, most of his feuds ended up canceled, and he was gone in one year. This gimmick got an inadvertent shoutout recently, when Alexa Bliss had Randy Orton coughing up black vomit on&nbsp;Raw.</p><h2 id=the-godfather-2002><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Godfather (2002)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WWE-The-Godfather.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Godfather had a great run in WWE with his gimmick. However, he dropped in popularity thanks to the Right to Censor gimmick, and when he returned to the Godfather gimmick in 2002, it just wasn't the same.</p><p>He showed up at the Royal Rumble with the Ho Train, much to the excitement of fans, but then he only wrestled sporadically for the next six months, before he finally accepted his release from WWE and quietly retired from wrestling altogether.</p><h2 id=the-goodfather><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Goodfather</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Right-To-Censor-Cropped.jpg><p><a href=#>Godfather has often said he hated his time in Right to Censor</a>, but it was honestly a great gimmick, and he was a perfect addition.

The group was a heat magnet, and Goodfather ended up in a successful tag team with Bull Buchanon, winning the titles.</p><h2 id=kama-mustafa><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kama Mustafa</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_11022021_104212_1000_x_500_pixel.jpg><p>It wasn't necessarily Kama Mustafa that was a great gimmick. <a href=#>It was the Nation of Domination</a> that was one of the best factions in professional wrestling history. The group was based on the civil unrest in the '90s, and they were a wrestling angle that had meaning far beyond just the wrestling ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kama Mustafa became Godfather at the end of this, but as a part of the Nation, he was able to tell one of the best stories in wrestling during the Attitude Era.</p><h2 id=the-godfather><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Godfather</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Godfather-Intercontinental-Champion-Cropped.jpg><p>The Godfather left the Nation of Domination and became the best he ever was. In the Nation, Farooq was the original leader and brought the group together to fight injustice from inside WWE. <a href=#>When The Rock took over as leader</a>, it was about making sure he was ready to win the world championship. In 1998, they broke up, and Godfather was freed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Godfather dressed in colorful clothing with loud gold jewelry and took the gimmick of a pimp. He would always yell, "pimpin' ain't easy," and lead his Ho-Train to the ring, which was usually four to five scantily clad women. He was the most successful at this time, too, as <a href=#>he won the Intercontinental Championship</a> from Goldust in 1999, his only singles title. This was also when he achieved his biggest win ever, a victory over Triple H in 2000.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Wrestlers Who Were Special Attractions" href=#>10 Wrestlers Who Were Special Attractions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnpJ2ybrPOnZ2arJiav27CxKuqoqeeYr%2Biusqem2avn6fAtXnBnqqtZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-pronounce-elyse-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to pronounce elyse</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-actor-justin-tyler-berfield-from-malcolm-in-the-middle-his-wiki-net-worth-today-sister-girlfriend-bio-526982-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is actor Justin Tyler Berfield from Malcolm in the Middle?
