When the paper was expanded and renamed PanAfrica, he became its editor-in-chief. In 1963 he was elected as one of Kenya’s representatives in the Central Legislative Assembly of the East African Common Services Organisation.</p><p>Pinto, on his part, had almost nothing to his name. His wife, Emma, was the family’s breadwinner. Their home in Nairobi’s Lower Kabete Road was a gift from an admirer.</p><p>After Pinto was assassinated in 1965, Emma was shocked to find that there was no money in the bank account to pay the rent.</p><p>He had reportedly been warned earlier that his life was in danger because powerful forces in government were unhappy with his activities, but he refused to flee the country.</p><p>He was shot as he drove out of his home and a certain Kisilu Mutua was arrested and convicted for the killing.</p><p>His assassination was the first in post-independence Kenya.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLe1w56mZpyZmLhus9GenqiqqWKyubzLmqCnq12stbp5zJqjnKeconq5v4ykoKWklafAbsPEq5xmqJ%2BowKquy7Jkm52Ynrulec%2BipmafkaKubrzIp6uoq12WwLSt0qygp5mknryvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mayra-hermosillo-height-in-feet-and-wikipedia-meet-the-actress-who-plays-enedina-arellano-felix-in-narcos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mayra Hermosillo Height In Feet And Wikipedia: Meet The Actress Who Plays Enedina Arellano Flix In</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-wendy-lee-pole-dance-instructor-dead-death-cause-what-happened-to-the-real-wendy-lee-281074-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Wendy Lee Pole Dance Instructor Dead?
