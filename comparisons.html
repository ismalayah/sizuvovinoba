Our heroes' pokemon decide to help it out, so they search all over the snow-covered area to retrieve them.&nbsp; Waninoko gets one that landed on top of a boat, and Yorunozuku is able to find one hidden in a tree.&nbsp; A third present is discovered by a wild Aipom who decides to make things difficult by forcing the pokemon to chase after it!&nbsp; After the final present is retrieved from the top of a tree, Delibird is able to return the gifts to Santa Claus.&nbsp; In "White Story," the same group of pokemon make a Kabigon snowman one day.&nbsp; Much to their surprise, the snowman comes alive and takes them on an adventure!&nbsp; The gang slides around, gets trapped in a whirlpool, see lots of water pokemon, and create a boat made of ice, all before the snowman Kabigon returns to its friends. &nbsp;</span></span></i></p><p><b><u><span><span>Thoughts&nbsp;</span></span></u></b><br><span><span>Before diving into the <span>Shuukan Pokemon Housoukyoku</span> episodes, 4Kids decides to dub a four-year old Winter's Vacation OVA they missed.&nbsp; If you've seen the other Pikachu's Winter Vacation OVA's, you'll know what to expect; a fun adventure that you can turn your brain off to and watch as the pokemon get involved in various shenanigans.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>For your reference, this OVA was released between episodes 180, "<span>Popokko!&nbsp; The Grass Pokemon Battle Tournament</span>" ("The Grass Stop") and 181, "<span>Pichu and Pikachu</span>" ("The Apple Corp!").<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>The dub version seems like it was returned to the crew that works on the regular TV series because the quality improves dramatically.&nbsp; We get to keep some of the Japanese music, there aren't any major cuts, and the pokemon all sound like the versions from the TV show.&nbsp; Could the crappiness of "<a href=#>The Legend of Thunder</a>" be a one-time occurrence?</span></span></p><span readability=13.286467486819>In the Japanese version, <span>Howaito Dansu</span> is used as the opening theme and <a href=#><span>Mou Sugu Santa ga Yatte Kuru!</span></a> is used as the ending theme to this OVA.&nbsp; The American version uses the typical <span>Pokémon Chronicles</span> stuff.<p>Pikachu, Togepi, Yorunozuku, Airmd, and Aipom keep their Japanese voices.</p><p><span><span>Side Note</span></span><br>So the special starts, and...4KIDS LEFT IT IN WIDESCREEN!!!!!!!&nbsp; WHOOOO!!!!!!</p><p>Though it is weird that 4Kids will leave the most inane, pointless animated shorts in widescreen while the theatrical features get cropped for American audiences.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll take what I can get.<br></p></span><p><span><span><span><span>Dialogue Edit</span></span><br>In the first short, "Delibird's Dilemma," the narrator is changed from the kindly young woman in the Japanese version to Santa Claus for the dub.&nbsp;<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Also, Santa Claus as a narrator is <span>way</span> more talkative than the lady in the Japanese version.&nbsp; And did you hear the way he butchers the pronunciation of Bulbasaur's name?&nbsp; I mean, what the hell's a "B<span>a</span>lbasaur?"<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Music Edit</span></span><br>When Delibird and the gang start to look for its missing presents, a vocal song is heard in the Japanese version.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the name of the song is since I'm not familiar with the Winter's Vacation music, but it's an appropriately light-hearted song.&nbsp; The dub replaces this song with their opening theme to the first Pikachu's Winter Vacation OVA.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Speaking of music...4Kids only used two of the original pieces of background music for the dub, but the two they used were pretty awesome.&nbsp; The first one was an old Kanto piece that we haven't heard them use since Johto, and the second one, the one that ends the episode, is one that I don't think we've EVER heard in the dub before.&nbsp;<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>It really seems like they're trying to make up for "The Legend of Thunder," doesn't it?<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Cut--14 seconds</span></span><br>A little scene transition thingee </span></span><span><span>featuring a bunch of Nati and Natio crossing the street</span></span><span><span> is cut out of the TV broadcast.&nbsp; I hear this footage was restored for the DVD release.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Video Edit</span></span><br>4Kids gets a little lazy and reuses the title screen from "Delibird's Present" for "Snorlax Snowman."&nbsp; Originally, the second story had its very own title screen.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><img alt=Japanese src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/chronicles/04_whitestory_j.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img alt=English src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/chronicles/04_whitestory_e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Dialogue Edit</span></span><br>The narrator is changed for the second story as well, but instead of Santa Claus, we get the regular TV show narrator.&nbsp; What IS it with 4Kids and not having any female narrators, anyway?<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Also, in contrast to the previous short, the narrator of the dubbed version of this one doesn't talk much at all.&nbsp; I think Mr. Pollock is given all of two lines at the beginning of the short and then doesn't say anything for the rest of the episode.&nbsp; Strange.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Finally, the snowman Snorlax sort of <span>snores</span> the first syllable of its name in the dub.&nbsp; I'm not all that bothered about it since you can argue that this Snorlax isn't real and is therefore allowed to have a different voice, but it's still odd sounding.&nbsp;<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Added Footage--9 seconds</span></span><br>In the dub, a commercial break is placed right as the pokemon are headed into a whirlpool.&nbsp; We see the gang scream and head into the whirlpool, the show goes on commercial break, and then we see that same footage repeated.&nbsp;<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>This didn't happen in the Japanese version since it was released straight to video and therefore didn't have any commercial interruptions.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Music Edit</span></span><br>When the pokemon are looking at the pokemon underwater, the dub plays this vocal song that I guess is called "Magic in the Night."&nbsp; The Japanese version plays some surfing-esque background music.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Later, another vocal is added in the dub when there was only instrumental music in the Japanese version.<br></span></span></p><span></span> <span></span> <span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn5yutMGNm6ylmpGcrrOwxKdlp52kZLCwuc%2BaqaKrn6PAcK%2FHq6anoZOhsrR7xKlnaWxencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marvin-gaye-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marvin Gaye Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexis-skyy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexis Skyy- Net Worth, Biography, Age, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-b-jordan-and-russo-brothers-thomas-crown-affair-remake-moving-forward.html>Michael B.
