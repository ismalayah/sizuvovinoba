While things seemed to be smooth sailing at first, Keenan quickly became rather wishy-washy, getting to know every bombshell that walked into the villa, including both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Chavez</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Imani Wheeler</a>. With Vickala remaining 100% committed to Keenan, viewers began arguing that the Texas native deserved a man who was head over heels for her and not willing to turn his head as soon as another woman walked into the villa.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>After dozens of arguments, Keenan finally decided that he wanted to ask Kay Kay to be his girlfriend and close things off once and for all; however, the <a href=#>infamous Casa Amor week</a> threw a wrench into his plans. Seemingly forgetting about Kay Kay, Keenan got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">down and dirty</a> with&nbsp;Najah Fleary under the covers. Because of the blatant disrespect he showed towards his significant other, Keenan rubbed fans of the franchise the wrong way, causing him to be dumped from the villa after a fan vote put him at the bottom of the bunch.</p><p data-characters=735 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>Despite being screwed over by the 23-year-old time and time again, Kay Kay remained loyal to Keenan, making the decision to self-eliminate herself from the show alongside her counterpart, admitting that she “found what she came here for” and did not need to stay in the villa any longer. Leaving Fiji hand in hand, Kay Kay and Keenan survived the trials and tribulations of their relationship and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">remained a couple after Love Island: USA season 5 came to a close</a>, sharing quite a few lovey-dovey photos on Instagram. While things seemed to be peachy keen between the lovebirds, Kay Kay and Keenan have since deleted their photos with one another, leaving fans of the franchise with just one burning question: what happened?</p><h2 id=h-why-did-vickala-gray-and-keenan-anunay-break-up data-injectable=false>Why did Vickala Gray and Keenan Anunay break up?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@toohotteaa href=#>@toohotteaa</a><p><a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=kaykayandkeenan href=#>#kaykayandkeenan</a> <a title=loveislandusa href=#>#loveislandusa</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=soultiesiscrazy href=#>#soultiesiscrazy</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Toohottea" href=#>♬ original sound – Toohottea</a></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>In a TikTok livestream, Vickala dished about her breakup with Keenan, and while she did not explicitly admit where their relationship stands now, she seems to be on good terms with Keenan, admitting that the breakup was primarily due to the duo “healing from the show” rather than any sort of infidelity.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>To kick off the conversation, Kay Kay defended Keenan and his behavior, admitting that while his actions on Love Island: USA were rather questionable, “There was a huge change in, like, his energy and his respect, and you know, it was just different” post-filming.</p><p>“We were actually in a committed relationship. It was different. Everything was to prioritize me… He gave me that for sure. I cannot say he has not given me that, because he’s been doing that. Definitely, he has been doing that. I think that a big part of our relationship, none of the struggles were due to like cheating… He wasn’t in the streets. He ain’t been in the streets, stuff like that. It’s just mainly like healing from the show.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>With Love Island: All Stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">right around the corner</a>, could Kay Kay or Keenan make their return to the franchise in an effort to find their perfect match?
