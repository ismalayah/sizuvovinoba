Each of the ugliest Star Wars characters serves a purpose, creating a sense of fear or absurdity. Since the release of Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977, over 20,000 characters have been created. Some like Lando Calrissian are drop-dead gorgeous while others like Jabba the Hutt revel in the foulness of their appearance.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Not every character in Star Wars embraced their ugliness like Jabba, sometimes appearing out of place or fake, while others simply had no idea how offsetting their look was. From eggs ready to hatch to bounty hunters seeking glory, here are the 10 ugliest Star Wars characters:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-bossk data-injectable=false>10. Bossk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rea6HFTioS7n6Xd2VwGbQH.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Ranked as one of the most popular characters in the Star Wars Universe, Bossk isn’t beloved for his good looks. Based on pressure suits worn by pilots in the British Royal Air Force, the bounty hunter’s swag attire helped his overall appearance, in conjunction with his reputation. The Bossk’s awkward appearance to non-reptilians, and Trandoshan hunting skills, earned him the status of one of the most feared bounty hunters within the Star Wars Universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>A former mentor and bodyguard for Boba Fett during his teen years, Bossk utilized his instincts and his drive for credit to become one of the best bounty hunters. The two were not good friends, though, with Bossk likely jealous of Fett’s charm with the ladies. The two bounty hunters often competed with one another for the best-paying jobs, with Fett beating Bossk in the race to claim Han Solo in Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-ubbla-mollbro data-injectable=false>9. Ubbla Mollbro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xidec-01.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Featured in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Ubbla Mollbro set aside appearance in exchange for a hatching mate. The Xi’Dec opera singer went to the Canto Bight Casino covered in eggs and a drape of her own making. She even brought along her dog, who goes flying during her scene within TLJ.</p><h2 id=h-8-greedo data-injectable=false>8. Greedo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/D64CD8CF-6274-4F23-9628-2F7D85596D71.jpeg><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Envious of other bounty hunters, Greedo bit off more than he could chew with the attempted capture of Han Solo in Star Wars: A New Hope. The pea-green-colored hunter wanted fame and glory — to be the center of attention, with individuals overlooking his off-setting appearance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Greedo was a Rodian, with eyes too big for his little head and a snout that didn’t say “kiss me.” The underworld didn’t take him seriously, mostly due to his lack of skills, but also because of his appearance and scheming ways. Unable to hit his target in life, Greedo passed on without ever achieving glory and fame.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-7-poggle-the-lesser data-injectable=false>7. Poggle The Lesser</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/databank_pogglethelesser_01_169_7095ae3c.jpg><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Leader of the Geonosian race during the Clone Wars, Poggle the Lesser spent too much time in battle droid factories, and not enough self-grooming. Geonosians built and designed the first Death Star, failing to complete the ship’s primary firing function before the battle of Geonosis.&nbsp; The Geonosian race was inspired by insects like termites, caring little for themselves and more about increasing their population numbers. Poggle the Lesser gave off an appearance of being the alpha but in truth was just another tool for the Geonosian Queen and Darth Sidious.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-6-jar-jar-binks data-injectable=false>6. Jar Jar Binks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-171.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Jar Jar Binks had numerous CGI flaws that made him look bad. But when compared to other Gungans, his unnatural qualities stood out like a sore thumb. Poor Jar Jar never had ill intentions though, despite his awkwardness and clumsiness.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Most Gungans had their eyes on top of their heads, with Boss Nass being an exception. Jar Jar’s protruded from his head like two antennas, with eyes too large and a smile too creepy to ignore. His tongue was abnormally long and the Gungan’s other body parts were either too big or small compared to the rest of Jar Jar’s body structure.</p><h2 id=h-5-bib-fortuna data-injectable=false>5. Bib Fortuna</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Book-of-Boba-Fett-1.jpg><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Having earned himself the title of Jabba’s ear through hard work and evil schemes, Bib Fortuna wasn’t always one of the ugliest Star Wars characters. In his younger days, the Twi’lek was fit and attentive. Working for Jabba the Hutt over decades took a toll on Fortuna’s health, turning him into a pasty and slimy puppet during the events of Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Following the defeat of Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Fortuna took over as the Tatooine underworld boss, becoming more like his former employer in appearance every day. Upon his confrontation with Boba Fett years later, Bib Fortuna couldn’t even move to defend himself due to his years of indulgence.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-4-figrin-d-an-and-the-all-bith-band data-injectable=false>4. Figrin D’an And The All-Bith band</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/download-7.jpg><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>Years of performing the Kloo Horn shaped Figrin D’an’s future as a leader for his band. It also shaped the band leader’s face into a ripple of muscles, earning him the nickname “Fiery” Figrin. In addition to Figrin D’an’s protruding chops, the musician sported overly large eyes and a stereotypical alien-shaped head. Figrin D’an was also a compulsive gambler. The band leader was overly critical of his musicians, earning a reputation that went beyond his funky looks.</p><h2 id=h-3-watto data-injectable=false>3. Watto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Watto-star-wars-attack-of-the-clones.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Tatooine junk dealer Watto represented much of what the dessert planet had to offer in the underworld circles. Missing numerous teeth with flies buzzing around him constantly, the long snouted Toydarian in Mos Espa cared only for his next big score.&nbsp; Even Watto’s outfits were made to highlight his off-put appearance, from pants fitted under his drooping belly to a cheesy safari-style hat that offered little to no protection from the twin suns beaming down on Watto.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-2-bargwill-tomder data-injectable=false>2. Bargwill Tomder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tlj-db-bargwill-tomder-main-image_40c3eecb.jpg><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>Mean to children and ugly, Bargwill Tomder was in charge of the fathier stables at the Canto Bight casino and racetrack, featured in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Having four arms and a rotting-looking face, the Cloddogran favored his raggedy red shirt with a tool vest and brown hat.&nbsp; Bargwill Tomder also got joy out of disciplining child slaves that served under him, using his electro-shock prod on them as much as the fathiers. Mean to the bone, Tomder cared little for his appearance, utilizing his ugliness as a fear tactic against the urchin slaves.</p><h2 id=h-1-jabba-the-hutt data-injectable=false>1. Jabba The Hutt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bib-Fortuna-with-Jabba-the-Hutt.jpg><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>King of indulgence and crime syndicate ruler, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jabba the Hutt</a> was by far the ugliest Star Wars character ever created. Originally sketched as a fuzzy and potentially cute creature, Jabba became the drooling and slimy Hutt, feared by many for decades.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Adding to his grotesque appearance were sounds created by Ben Burtt. From hands running through a cheese casserole to the crime boss choking on his own chain at the hands of Leia, nothing about Jabba the Hutt was ever meant to be pleasing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-honorable-mention-mas-amedda data-injectable=false>Honorable mention: Mas Amedda</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/databank_chagrain_01_169_e8ce3def.jpg><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Mas Amedda served as a political puppet under the title of vice-chancellor to Supreme Chancellor Valorum and helped appoint Senator Palpatine as the new Supreme Chancellor in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The Chagrian likely knew Palpatine was Darth Sidious but didn’t care, putting his political ambitions above everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Always well-dressed while portraying an air of indifference, Mas Amedda utilized his appearance to instill fear in those who would challenge him. The vice-chancellor’s eyes often looked possessed and he was known to punctuate his words with a flick of his forked tongue.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>In conjunction with his fearful and odd appearance, Mas Amedda kept the Galatic Senate members in check for those in which he served.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWZ9bsHGpaCeq6RiwLWt0WaumqqjYrCprdGamq2doqh6s63NpJydZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-bat-devil-in-chainsaw-man.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is the Bat Devil in Chainsaw Man?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./one-true-thing-1998.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>One True Thing movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-b-jordan-and-russo-brothers-thomas-crown-affair-remake-moving-forward.html>Michael B.
