Check read this article to find out why he died. Michael Charles Leach, popularly known as Mike Leach, was the head football coach at Mississippi State University from 2020 until his tragic death on December 11, 2022.</p><p>Mike was the brains behind the NCAA record-breaking air raid offensive. During his active coaching career, the former Mississippi coach was twice named national coach of the year and three times conference coach of the year. Prior to joining Mississippi University, the coach was the head coach at Texas Tech University, when he became the school’s winningest coach, and at Washington State University. Mike, who is known for constructing explosive attacks and managing passing-oriented teams in a wide offensive scheme, has amassed the third-most victories of any coach in school history.</p><h2>Mike Leach’s Cause of Death And Obituary</h2><p>Mississippi State stated in a statement on December 13, 2022, that Leach had died the night before “from complications due to a heart condition.” Mississippi State coach Mike was brought to the hospital on December 11, 2022, in ‘critical’ condition after having what the school characterized as a personal health problem at home.&nbsp;According to Dailymail, the University provided no more information on Leach’s health.

Furthermore, Mississippi State University will make no further statement at this time other than to express the University’s condolences to Mike, Sharon, and their families. Mississippi State head football coach Mike Leach was hospitalized only weeks before the team’s bowl game, according to NCB sources.&nbsp;throughout the fourth season of Friday Night Light, the head coach explored non-sport pursuits throughout each off-season. He was a “random loon” at a gas station, instructing despondent coach Eric Taylor to “find your inner pirate” and “swing your sword.”</p><h2>Mike Leach Net Worth: Discover His Salary At the moment of death</h2><p>Because he did not play college football, Leach was unusual among NCAA Division I head coaches.&nbsp;Mike has set multiple schools and NCAA records and has garnered numerous honors, including AFCA Coach of the Year, the George Munger Award, the Woody Hayes Trophy, Big 12 Coach of the Year, and Pac-12 Coach of the Year twice.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mike-Leach-2.jpg alt="Mike Leach" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 1987, the head coach started his coaching career as an assistant at the College of the Desert and Cal Poly.
