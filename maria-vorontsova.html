She was a Ph.D. candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, which is directed by Dedov and administers the charity initiative Alfa-Endo for children with endocrine illnesses, with Ivan Ivanovich Dedov as her adviser.

Jorrit Faassen, her kind and caring spouse, is her husband. Jorrit is a wealthy businessman who rose to prominence after marrying President Vladimir Putin’s oldest daughter. He was assaulted by four bodyguards belonging to Russian financier Matvey Urin, co-owner of Trado-Bank, in November 2010.

Maria and Jorrit Faassen lived in a penthouse atop a residential building in Voorschoten, the Netherlands.

The couple was said to be residing in Moscow in 2015.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqZlnq3u9Gopa2rn6uucA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olympus-has-fallen-and-the-equalizer-director-helming-michael-jackson-biopic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olympus Has Fallen and The Equalizer director helming Michael Jackson biopic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mekki-leeper-bio-net-worth-height-age-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mekki Leeper Bio, Net Worth, Height, Age, Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-b-jordan-and-russo-brothers-thomas-crown-affair-remake-moving-forward.html>Michael B.
