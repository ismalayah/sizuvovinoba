He was heavily involved in the Civil Rights Movement, serving as a close advisor to Martin Luther King Jr., and by 1987 had been named a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>He’s been a vocal activist for decades now, starting all the way back in the 1950s and stretching to modern times. He resisted George W. Bush and his administration, as well as the Iraq war, and frequently pushed back against increasingly restrictive U.S. politics. Up until his death, he leaned heavily into political activism, with ties back to President Obama — and his father — as well as Bernie Sanders.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>On top of everything else, Belafonte dipped his toe into business, as well as film and television. His <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">legacy is far too long to detail</a> here, but he contributed nearly as much effort and impact to the world of politics as he did to the world of music, which he is best remembered for. His discography is (somehow) even longer than his political and humanitarian resumes, stretching over 30 years and just as many albums.</p><h2 id=h-harry-belafonte-s-many-many-musical-hits data-injectable=false>Harry Belafonte’s many, many musical hits</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Belafonte is best known for the above song, which made him a staple of the musical scene, but it’s far from his only release. It would be absurd to list all of Belafonte’s hits here, when there are so very many to detail, but we’ll examine a few standouts that deserve just as much attention and respect as “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song).”</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Like “We Are The World.” Sure, Gal Gadot’s attempt to replicate the impact of this timeless track went a bit awry, but the original — which released all the way back in 1985 — successfully raised massive funds for Africa, and its Grammy win was well-deserved.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>His first few albums aren’t as well known, but Belafonte truly entered the musical scene with Calypso. The 1956 album was the very first million-selling&nbsp;LP&nbsp;by a single artist, and launched Belafonte to broad success. It contains several persistently popular tracks, including “Day-O” and “Jamaica Farewell,” as well as “Man Smart (Woman Smarter).”</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Later albums, including Jump Up Calypso — which reached number three on the Billboard Pop Albums charts — include several broadly popular songs. You might not recognize “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump in the Line</a>” on sight, but I can all but guarantee you’ll know the song the second its first chords reach your ears.</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=false>There are plenty more, but it’s probably best for you to discover them for yourself. A quick perusal of the best Belafonte songs is rather challenging — given his absolutely massive discography — but a dedicated fan can find plenty of stellar tracks to enjoy in their searching. We suggest you start with “Day-O,” “Jump in the Line,” “Matilda, Matilda,” “Island in the Sun,” or, around Christmastime, “Mary’s Boy Child,” and see where your recommendations take you from there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqqoppeoeqW1w2afmqqirnqjscuanaimpJp6tLXNoGSorJiav27Ax5qlZpyRrnqwedOhnGaakaOur62Mm6aarF2ovK%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mauricio-huerta.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Exploring Sofia Huertas Salary and Career What We Know About Sofia Huertas Boyfriend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isiah-pacheco-salary-and-contract-with-kansas-city-chiefs-breakdown-461876-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Isiah Pacheco Salary And Contract With Kansas City Chiefs Breakdown</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-b-jordan-and-russo-brothers-thomas-crown-affair-remake-moving-forward.html>Michael B.
