Chris Osmond was a contestant on the television series <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claim to Fame</a>. </strong>While a younger generation might not have been able to draw a quick connection between the two, many others immediately spotted it.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Osmond spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> about the particular audience who likely knew immediately who was Chris’ relative:</p><p>“It’s funny because I can only imagine how many moms are screaming at the television because he’s done such a great job to keep it hidden. Everybody has been screaming at the television set, ‘Oh, it’s Donny Osmond.'”</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>The series’ premise was this: Twelve celebrity relatives were all placed in a house together, and their job was simple – figure out who was related to whom without letting their walls down and allowing others to discover their claim to fame. Osmond himself knows a thing or two about the reality realm, and he had some advice for his son:</p><p>“Obviously I’ve done several [reality shows] with&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars&nbsp;but this is totally different. So I [told him], ‘Just be as clever as you can in this kind of situation.’ And boy, has he been clever.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Donny Osmond (@donnyosmond)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>Osmond believed that a big part of the reason no one discovered their kinship was because of a generational gap, something he’s seen a time or two throughout his career:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“This dynamic of having Chris on the show, that’s what’s making it exciting because the older generation, they know exactly what it is. And the younger kids, they have no idea. This happens to me all the time, especially in my Vegas show when I do ‘I’ll Make a Man Out of You’ from&nbsp;Mulan. The younger generation come to my show but it surprises them that I’m Captain Shang and they can’t get that. These millennials, they know the song, they know all about it, but they just don’t know that it’s Donny Osmond.”</p><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=false>The series came to an exciting conclusion on Monday, August 28, and Chris was part of the final three in the running for the grand prize and had the honor of being called the winner of Claim to Fame‘s second season. We won’t give you spoilers if you’ve yet to see the conclusion of the season, but we will say this: despite who wins and who loses, this was undoubtedly an exciting watch, and we’re glad to see how much fun Chris had on the series and how much of a privilege Donny felt it was to watch along.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMisZKKrXam8ta3LpbBmnJmbs6a%2BxKerZpyfo7u6ec6spKimlGLAqa3RnqpmrJiaeqKw1aKanmWYmnqordWeZKGho2LAsLqMnJ%2BroaNirqmxwJ1kqJ5dmLmitcxmq6hllpa6pns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./none-of-the-struggles-were-due-to-cheating-love-island-usa-couple-vickala-kay-kay-gray-and-keenan-anunay-reveal-why-they-broke-up.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./janna-lapidus-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Janna Lapidus Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-b-jordan-and-russo-brothers-thomas-crown-affair-remake-moving-forward.html>Michael B.
